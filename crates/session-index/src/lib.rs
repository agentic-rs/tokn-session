//! A compact, app-owned SQLite index for historical agent sessions.
//!
//! The index deliberately stores only source checkpoints, session identity, and
//! bounded caller-supplied metadata. It never stores normalized events, native
//! provider payloads, reasoning, tool inputs, or tool outputs. `title` and a
//! bounded `preview` are the only caller-supplied presentation text the index
//! permits; callers should keep the preview bounded before indexing.
//!
//! A source replacement is transactional. Callers only invoke it after a
//! complete provider scan succeeds, which means sessions omitted from the
//! replacement can safely be tombstoned without treating a transient source
//! failure as deletion. When more than one process can refresh the index,
//! callers also attach the cursor observed before scanning as an optimistic
//! precondition, so a stale scan cannot overwrite a newer replacement.
